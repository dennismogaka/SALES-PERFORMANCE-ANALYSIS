# SALES-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS
I developed a comprehensive project in excel, with detailed tables with pivot tables and visualizations to analyze the sales performance of a company. This process includes a series of stages including data processing, data cleaning, descriptive statistics and visualisation.

## Project Objective
The sales performance data want to provide insights and recommendations to improve on revenue that dropped drastically between 2026 and 2027. The company will be able to make data-driven decisions about marketing and incorporating discounts from time to time to boost revenue.

## Data used
The data used for the work is gotten from www.kaggle.com
